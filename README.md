# ðŸ§  Text Generation with Frankenstein
An NLP Project Using PyTorch and LSTM

Train a neural network to generate original text in the style of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. This project showcases core deep learning and NLP concepts using PyTorch and character-level LSTM networks.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates:

âœ… Character-level tokenization and vocabulary mapping

âœ… Sequence modeling with PyTorchâ€™s Dataset and DataLoader

âœ… Building an LSTM-based neural network for next-character prediction

âœ… Training a model on classic literature using embeddings and CrossEntropyLoss

âœ… Generating novel text from a prompt using a trained model

Training is based on the first letter in Frankenstein using data from Project Gutenberg.

## ðŸ§  Technologies & Concepts
PyTorch â€“ deep learning framework used for model training and optimization

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) â€“ sequence model to learn character patterns

Embeddings â€“ dense vector representations of characters

Cross Entropy Loss â€“ used to predict the next most likely character

Text Generation â€“ generate human-like text one character at a time
